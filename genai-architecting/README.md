## Functional Requirements

## Assumptions

We are assuming that the Open-Source LLMs that we choose will be powerful enough to run on hardware with an investment of $10-15K.

We are just going to hook up a single server in a office to the internet and we should have enough bandwidth to serve 300 students.

## Data Strategy


## Considerations

We are considering using IBM Granite because it is a truly open source model with training data that is traceable, so we can avoid copyright infringement issues and we are able to discern what is taking place in the model.
